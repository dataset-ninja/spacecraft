**Spacecraft Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, object detection, and identification tasks. It is used in the robotics industry. 

The dataset consists of 2495 images with 11450 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *spacecraft*, *body*, *solar panel*, and other: *antenna*.

Images in the Spacecraft Dataset dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2145 images) and *val* (350 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 2 qualities of masks: ***coarse mask*** (1799 images) and ***fine mask*** (696 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">University of Adelaide, Australia</span>.
